```
u <- c(2,3,4)
v <- c(3,4,5,6,7,8)
```

* `(5 7 9 6 7 8)`
* `NaN`
* `(5 7 9 8 10 12)`
* `(3 4 5 8 10 12)`

##  Lecture 1b

* Both lists and vectors
* Lists
* Vectors
* Matrices

## Lecture 2a

cbind() function is used for what type of data?

* Vectors, matrices and data frames
* Vectors and matrices
* Data frames only
* Vectors only

## Lecture 2b

Indentify the distribution type in the following code:
```
x <- seq(0, 4, 0.1)
plot(x, dnorm(x, 2, 0.5), type = "l”)
```

* Normal
* Poisson
* Unified constant 
* Binomial

## Lecture 3a

What needs to be changed in the following code for values to be arranged row wise in ascending order?
```
m <- matrix(1:20, nrow=5,ncol=4)
```

* `byrow = TRUE`
* `bycol = TRUE`
* `byrow = FALSE`
* No change required in the code

## Lecture 3b 

Indentify the correct code used for augumenting the square matrix (S_quare (nxn)) by binding an identity matrix on the right?

* `cbind(S_quare, diag(n))`
* `rbind(S_quare, diag(n))`
* `outer(S_quare, diag(n),"+")`
* `cbind(S_quare, diag(0))`

## Lecture 4a

What is the correct way to vectorize the following code:
```
for(i in 1:3) x[i] <- i+i
```

* `x <- c(1,2,3) + c(1, 2, 3)`
* `for i in range(1,4):
    x+= [i+i]`
* `while i<4:
    x+= [2i]`
* `for(i<4) x[i] <- 2i`


## Lecture 4b:

Which equation best describes an orthogonal matrix? (Q* = Q transpose)

* (1/Q)= Q*
* QI = IQ*
* Q^-1*Q = Q
* Q*I = I

## Lecture 5a

What is the correct code to find mean of following matrix, leaving the not available values?
```
age <- c(12,15,16, NA, 18, 30, NA)
```

* mean(age, na.rm=TRUE)
* mean(age)
* mean cannot be found
* mean (age, rm(any.na))

## Lecture 5b

What is the correct code for subtracting two dates from one another and then cast the difference to a numeric value? 

* `(as.Date("2014-10-10") - as.Date("2014-10-1")) %>% as.numeric`
* `as.Date("2014-10-10") - as.Date("2014-10-1") %>% as.numeric`
* `as.numeric %>% (as.Date("2014-10-10" - "2014-10-1" ))`
* `as.Date %>% ("2014-10-10") - as.Date %>% ("2014-10-1") >%> as.numeric`
