```
u <- c(2,3,4)
v <- c(3,4,5,6,7,8)
```

* `(5 7 9 6 7 8)`
* `NaN`
* `(5 7 9 8 10 12)`
* `(3 4 5 8 10 12)`

##  Lecture 1b

What data type does apply function return?

* Both lists and vectors
* Lists
* Vectors
* Matrices

## Lecture 2a

cbind() function is used for what type of data?

* Vectors, matrices and data frames
* Vectors and matrices
* Data frames only
* Vectors only

## Lecture 2b

Indentify the distribution type in the following code:
```
x <- seq(0, 4, 0.1)
plot(x, dnorm(x, 2, 0.5), type = "l”)
```

* Normal
* Poisson
* Unified constant 
* Binomial

## Lecture 3a

What needs to be changed in the following code for values to be arranged row wise in ascending order?
```
m <- matrix(1:20, nrow=5,ncol=4)
```

* `byrow = TRUE`
* `bycol = TRUE`
* `byrow = FALSE`
* No change required in the code

## Lecture 3b 

Indentify the correct code used for augumenting the square matrix (S_quare (nxn)) by binding an identity matrix on the right?

* `cbind(S_quare, diag(n))`
* `rbind(S_quare, diag(n))`
* `outer(S_quare, diag(n),"+")`
* `cbind(S_quare, diag(0))`

## Lecture 4a

What is the correct way to vectorize the following code:
```
for(i in 1:3) x[i] <- i+i
```

* `x <- c(1,2,3) + c(1, 2, 3)`
* `for(i in range(1,4)) x+= [i+i]`
* `while(i<4) x+= [2i]`
* `for(i<4) x[i] <- 2i`


## Lecture 4b:

Which equation best describes an orthogonal matrix? (Q* = Q transpose)

* (1/Q)= Q*
* QI = IQ*
* Q^-1*Q = Q
* Q*I = I

## Lecture 5a

What is the correct code to find mean of following matrix, leaving the not available values?
```
age <- c(12,15,16, NA, 18, 30, NA)
```

* mean(age, na.rm=TRUE)
* mean(age)
* mean cannot be found
* mean (age, rm(any.na))

## Lecture 5b

What is the correct code for subtracting two dates from one another and then cast the difference to a numeric value? 

* `(as.Date("2014-10-10") - as.Date("2014-10-1")) %>% as.numeric`
* `as.Date("2014-10-10") - as.Date("2014-10-1") %>% as.numeric`
* `as.numeric %>% (as.Date("2014-10-10" - "2014-10-1" ))`
* `as.Date %>% ("2014-10-10") - as.Date %>% ("2014-10-1") >%> as.numeric`

## Lecture 6a

Does case sensitivity matter while using SQL in R?

* Yes
* No

## Lecture 6b 

What is the output of the following code?
```
x <- function(numRows=5, numCols=5, probZero=0.7, seed=NULL){
  if(!is.null(seed)) set.seed(seed)
	matrix( rnbinom(numRows * numCols, prob=probZero, size=1), nrow=numRows )
}
```

* Generates a random sparse matrix
* Generates a random vector 
* Generates bionomial distribution values and stores them in x
* The code does not work

## Lecture 7a

Which of these is not a problem with messy data

* Values stored in table format
* Multiple variables stored in a single column
* Variables stored in both rows and columns
* Multiple types of entities in the same table

## Lecture 7b

Which of these lines of code cannot be used to generate a random data set?

* `qnorm(c(.05,.95))`
* `replicate( 100, runif(n=20))`
* `n <- rnorm(2500, mean=65, sd=4.58)`
* `z=rnorm(20, mean=10, sd=3)`
