## Lecture 8a 

What functions can you use to create a sequence over colors in R??

* All of these
* `colorRampPalette`
* `colorRamp`
* `rainbow_hcl`

##  Lecture 8b

What functions can you use to do Principal Component Analysis in R?

* `prcomp()`, `princomp()`, `PCA()`, `dudi.pca(`) and `acp()`
* Only `prcomp()`, `princomp()` and `PCA()`
* `prcomp()` can be used but gives inaccurate results. `PCA()` is the only option
* Only `PCA()`

## Lecture 9a

What is the cut function used for?

* Convert numeric to factor
* Cut of the trailing floating point numbers
* Consider specific number of values from a list

* `rvest`

## Lecture 10a

What would be the outcome of the following code?
```
x <- runif(1000, min=-10, max=10)
y <- x^2
z <- 2*y + 5*x + 6
plot(x,z)
library(rgl)
plot3d(x,y,z)
```

* An interactive 3D plot and a 2D plot 
* A 2D plot
* A 3D plot
* There is an error in the code
 
## Lecture 10b

plot(g)
```

* Undirected graph
* Directed graph
* Mixed graph
* Weighted graph

## Lecture 12a

* `shinyApp`
* None of these 

## Lecture 13a

Which of the following statements is FALSE?

* Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between independent variables. 
* Logistic regression is useful when you are predicting a binary outcome from a set of continuous predictor variables.
* Poisson regression is useful when predicting an outcome variable representing counts from a set of continuous predictor variables.
* Survival analysis covers a set of techniques for modeling the time to an event. 

## Lecture 13b 

What is the use of `dev.off()` function?

* Used to close open figure files and plotting windows
